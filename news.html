          </div>
          <div class="story-hidden-content">
            <p>This summer, Robina Azizi—founder of GPC (Girls on the Path of Change) and a passionate advocate for
              children’s rights—embarked on a life-changing journey to Mombasa, Kenya, as part of the Global Encounters
              2025 program. What started as a volunteer opportunity quickly became one of the most meaningful personal
              experiences of her life.<br><br>

              Over several weeks, Robina worked closely with children at Mvita Primary School, engaging in playful
              learning activities, sharing stories, planting trees, and building deep connections. Her belief was simple
              but powerful: every child deserves access to education, joy, and opportunity.<br><br>

              “I’ve always dreamed of visiting Africa,” Robina shared. “To finally be in Kenya, not just as a visitor,
              but actively working with children, was beyond anything I imagined.”</p>
            <div class="news-hidden-photos">

            </div>
            <p>Her visit came just a month after starting a new volunteer role with UNICEF, supporting children in Gaza.
              That recent experience made her time in Kenya even more personal—uniting two regions through one shared
              mission: uplifting children through education, empathy, and action.<br><br>

              While in Mombasa, Robina was welcomed at the Aga Khan Academy, where she participated in workshops
              alongside youth from around the world. The program focused on leadership, sustainability, and global
              citizenship. She also gained firsthand insight into the work of the Aga Khan Development Network
              (AKDN)—visiting schools, hospitals, media institutions, and development programs that support education,
              healthcare, and livelihoods across Kenya.<br><br>

              But amid all the unforgettable moments, one touched her more deeply than she could have
              anticipated.<br><br>

              On her birthday, Robina spent the day at Mvita School, immersed in laughter, learning, and photos with the
              children. She had completely forgotten the date—until the students surprised her with a spontaneous
              celebration. They gathered around her and began singing birthday songs in both English and Swahili,
              filling the space with joy and warmth.<br><br>

              “It was such a beautiful surprise,” she said. “I didn’t expect anything. Then suddenly they were singing
              and smiling—it was a moment I’ll never forget.”</p>
            <div class="news-hidden-photos">

            </div>
            <p>That day, there were no phone calls or birthday notifications. But what she received was even more
              powerful: human connection, love, and the kind of kindness that stays with you for a lifetime.<br><br>

              “This is what I’d wish for every year: meaningful work, full hearts, and unexpected joy.”<br><br>

              As Robina continues her journey with UNICEF and GPC – Girls on the Path of Change, her time in Kenya
              remains a lasting reminder of the strength of youth, the importance of global unity, and the magic that
              happens when we show up for one another.
