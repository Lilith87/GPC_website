            <p>Girls on the Path of Change (GPC) was founded in April 2023 by Robina Azizi, who,
              having personally experienced the challenges of being deprived of education, was
              inspired to create an organization that would empower Afghan girls and women. Her
              vision was to foster a global community for learning, support, and resilience. GPC
              operates independently without external organizational support, but it has rapidly
              grown into a network, reaching hundreds of students and volunteers across the world.</p>

                <p>Educational Opportunities and Event & Outreach Departments The Educational Opportunities
                  Department:

                  was proposed by Fatima Moqadam, with the support of
                  Girls on the Path of Change, in response to the urgent need for accessible learning opportunities
                  for Afghan girls,
                  especially after the fall of Kabul. This department has since grown into one of the most active
                  and
                  impactful
                  sectors of the organization. Recognizing the
                  synergies between the Educational Opportunities and Event & Outreach departments, we merged the
                  two
                  to amplify
                  our efforts and reach even more students. Fatima, as
                  the leader of the Educational Opportunities Department, now co-leads the combined department with
                  Ananya
                  Mishra, the former head of the Event & Outreach Department. Together, we guide a dynamic
                  international team
                  with members from India, Kenya, the Philippines, Afghanistan, the U.S., and beyond in this
                  department.</p>
                <p>Why This Department Exists?

                  Our mission is to empower young Afghan students - particularly girls - by equipping them with the
                  knowledge, skills, and opportunities needed to thrive academically, professionally, and
                  personally,
                  despite the challenges they face. We believe that education, skill-building, and global exposure
                  are
                  critical to unlocking new futures for Afghan youth.
                </p>
                <p>What We Do:

                  We focus our efforts through three main initiatives:
                  1. Educational Webinars: We provide students with direct, practical guidance on accessing academic
                  opportunities globally. Our webinars have already covered prestigious scholarships such as UWC
                  (United World Colleges),
                  Asian University for Women, and Turkey Scholarships, offering clear roadmaps on application
                  processes and success strategies. We continue to expand our offerings to
                  reach even more students.

                  2. Professional Development Sessions: We build professional readiness by teaching essential
                  real-world skills such as CV writing, resume building, email writing, LinkedIn optimization, and
                  more. These sessions help students prepare for
                  both academic advancement and future careers locally and internationally. Many of these webinars
                  have already been personally led by Fatima Moqadam and more are
                  planned in the coming months.

                  3. Special Events: We host major events to celebrate global educational and cultural milestones
                  such
                  as World Book
                  Day, International Women's Day, and International Education Day. These events create spaces for
                  dialogue, learning, cultural exchange, and connection across borders.
                </p>
                <p>Our Achievements:

                  Since October 2023, the department has successfully organized more than 10 webinars and events.
                  In many of these initiatives, Fatima Moqadam herself served as the lead presenter, sharing her
                  personal experiences in applying for scholarships, preparing college applications, building strong
                  CVs and cover letters; she isn't just helping, she is shaping the vision. We have also invited
                  distinguished guest speakers to bring broader expertise and perspectives to our students. One
                  recent
                  highlight was our celebration of World Book Day 2025, where participants from
                  Afghanistan, India, Kenya, and other countries shared stories about books that had deeply impacted
                  their lives. This cross-cultural dialogue promoted not only a love of reading but also empathy,
                  critical thinking, and connection across borders. We continue to host such events around major
                  global days like International Women's Day and Education Day to inspire and unite young people. We
                  are proud
                  of the foundation we have built and remain committed to hosting even more impactful sessions and
                  events in the future. Moving Forward
                  With strong leadership, a passionate team, and a clear mission, the Educational Opportunities and
                  Event & Outreach Department remains committed to expanding learning opportunities and nurturing
                  talents. We will continue to build programs that not only educate but also connect and empower -
                  helping young Afghans rise beyond limitations
                  and create brighter futures.</p>
