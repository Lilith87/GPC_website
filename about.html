              <h2>Our History</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Girls on the Path of Change began with one girl, one dream, and one unshakable belief: that education is
              power.
              The story begins with Robina Azizi, a 16-year-old girl and 10th grade student living in Balkh,
              Afghanistan, who dreamed of completing her education and advocating for girls’ rights. In 2021, as the
              Taliban regained control of the country, Robina’s life was upended. She was forced to leave school during
              her exams and flee her home to protect her life and that of her family. Her writings, activism, and
              commitment to human rights placed her at serious risk.
            </p>
            <div class="hide-history">
              <p>Even in exile, Robina refused to give up. In Kabul, she resumed her education
                through online courses and
                began helping other girls access learning opportunities. Despite limited resources and constant danger,
                she used her voice to raise awareness in the media and within her community. Her goal was clear: to
                ensure
                Afghan girls would not be forgotten.
                In April 2023, Robina founded and launched a movement called “Girls on the Path of Change.” What started
                as a small effort quickly grew into a powerful community of girls from across Afghanistan who were
                determined to keep learning, no matter the risks. GPC started its first inspiring program, named “The
                Story of Schoolgirls,” which united 20 girls from different provinces in a shared mission to advocate
                for
                education.
                GPC then grew to provide online language classes, creative writing workshops, mental health sessions,
                and seminars led by Afghan and international volunteers. Over 500 girls and boys joined the first round
                of
                classes. Girls participating in the movement organized exhibitions of their handmade crafts, poetry,
                books, and art.
                In June 2023, GPC hosted empowerment seminars attended by over 200 girls, offering safe spaces for
                self-expression, learning, and hope. In September, Robina represented over 1,000 girls by co-signing a
                global letter to world leaders, demanding action for the reopening of girls’ schools in Afghanistan.
                Today, Girls on the Path of Change continues to grow. Robina, now based in Germany, leads the movement
                with a global team of volunteers dedicated to restoring education, dignity, and opportunity to Afghan
                girls. Through advocacy, education, and collective resilience, GPC empowers the next generation of
                changemakers.

                GPC has inspired thousands of girls globally to learn, grow, and become changemakers in their
                communities. Our work and the powerful stories of our students have been featured by international media
                outlets and organizations, amplifying the voices of Afghan girls and shedding light on their
                struggles—and
                their resilience.

                In recognition of her tireless advocacy and leadership, GPC founder Robina Azizi was honored with the
                prestigious Diana Award in 2024. Her work continues to inspire and uplift a new generation of leaders.
                Soon,more girls will graduate from GPC’s online language school and academic academy, a powerful
                testament to what can be achieved even in the most difficult circumstances—when courage meets community
                and education becomes the path to change.

                <p>Educational Opportunities and Event & Outreach Departments The Educational Opportunities
                  Department:

                  was proposed by Fatima Moqadam, with the support of
                  Girls on the Path of Change, in response to the urgent need for accessible learning opportunities
                  for Afghan girls,
                  especially after the fall of Kabul. This department has since grown into one of the most active
                  and
                  impactful
                  sectors of the organization. Recognizing the
                  synergies between the Educational Opportunities and Event & Outreach departments, we merged the
                  two
                  to amplify
                  our efforts and reach even more students. Fatima, as
                  the leader of the Educational Opportunities Department, now co-leads the combined department with
                  Ananya
                  Mishra, the former head of the Event & Outreach Department. Together, we guide a dynamic
                  international team
                  with members from India, Kenya, the Philippines, Afghanistan, the U.S., and beyond in this
                  department.</p>
                <p>Why This Department Exists?

                  Our mission is to empower young Afghan students - particularly girls - by equipping them with the
                  knowledge, skills, and opportunities needed to thrive academically, professionally, and
                  personally,
                  despite the challenges they face. We believe that education, skill-building, and global exposure
                  are
                  critical to unlocking new futures for Afghan youth.
                </p>
                <p>What We Do:

                  We focus our efforts through three main initiatives:
                  1. Educational Webinars: We provide students with direct, practical guidance on accessing academic
                  opportunities globally. Our webinars have already covered prestigious scholarships such as UWC
                  (United World Colleges),
                  Asian University for Women, and Turkey Scholarships, offering clear roadmaps on application
                  processes and success strategies. We continue to expand our offerings to
                  reach even more students.

                  2. Professional Development Sessions: We build professional readiness by teaching essential
                  real-world skills such as CV writing, resume building, email writing, LinkedIn optimization, and
                  more. These sessions help students prepare for
                  both academic advancement and future careers locally and internationally. Many of these webinars
                  have already been personally led by Fatima Moqadam and more are
                  planned in the coming months.

                  3. Special Events: We host major events to celebrate global educational and cultural milestones
                  such
                  as World Book
                  Day, International Women's Day, and International Education Day. These events create spaces for
                  dialogue, learning, cultural exchange, and connection across borders.
                </p>
                <p>Our Achievements:

                  Since October 2023, the department has successfully organized more than 10 webinars and events.
                  In many of these initiatives, Fatima Moqadam herself served as the lead presenter, sharing her
                  personal experiences in applying for scholarships, preparing college applications, building strong
                  CVs and cover letters; she isn't just helping, she is shaping the vision. We have also invited
                  distinguished guest speakers to bring broader expertise and perspectives to our students. One
                  recent
                  highlight was our celebration of World Book Day 2025, where participants from
                  Afghanistan, India, Kenya, and other countries shared stories about books that had deeply impacted
                  their lives. This cross-cultural dialogue promoted not only a love of reading but also empathy,
                  critical thinking, and connection across borders. We continue to host such events around major
                  global days like International Women's Day and Education Day to inspire and unite young people. We
                  are proud
                  of the foundation we have built and remain committed to hosting even more impactful sessions and
                  events in the future. Moving Forward
                  With strong leadership, a passionate team, and a clear mission, the Educational Opportunities and
                  Event & Outreach Department remains committed to expanding learning opportunities and nurturing
                  talents. We will continue to build programs that not only educate but also connect and empower -
                  helping young Afghans rise beyond limitations
                  and create brighter futures.</p>
