            <p>As we celebrate GPC’s second anniversary, my heart is filled
              with gratitude and love. Dear Robina Jan, you are not just
              our mentor—you are our light, our hope, and the reason we
              dare to dream again. No words can truly express how grateful
              I am for this precious gift of education. Before GPC,
              I felt like my dreams were slipping away, like the world had
              turned its back on us. But then, GPC became a ray of light in my darkest days. It gave me knowledge,
              confidence, and a sense of purpose that I thought I had lost. Every class, every lesson, every moment here
              reminds me that even when everything feels impossible, we still have the power to rise.
              GPC has changed my life in ways I never imagined. It has taught
              me that no matter how dark the world gets, we carry the
              light within us. We are strong, we are resilient, and we will keep learning, growing, and fighting for our
              right to education.</p>

              <h3>Head of the Educational Opportunities Department

          <div class="story-hidden-content">
            <p>I have been working with Girls on the Path of Change (GPC) for over a year, leading the Educational
              Opportunities Department. This role has been one of the most meaningful experiences for me because it
              allows me to collaborate with an incredible international team. Working with people from different
              backgrounds has not only helped me grow as a leader but has also given me the opportunity to engage in
              cross-cultural exchange, teamwork, and communication on a global level. It’s inspiring to work with
              individuals who share the same passion for education and empowerment. Thanks to GPC for such an incredible
              opportunity. As the head of this department, we have successfully planned and conducted numerous webinars
              on topics such as scholarships, professional development, job applications (CV writing, email writing),
              and college applications (recommendation letter writing, personal statements) in most of which I myself
              have been the presenter. We have also invited guest speakers from different fields to provide diverse
              perspectives, ensuring our students receive valuable insights. What excites me the most is the impact
              we’ve made—we’ve reached and supported both girls and boys, helping them navigate their academic and
              professional journeys. Thanks to GPC for being such an incredible organization, bringing youth from around
              the globe to make a difference in the world. Beyond organizing webinars, I am also deeply committed to
              teaching. I have taught English with GPC before, and I continue to do so because I genuinely love sharing
              knowledge. Teaching is more than just a responsibility for me—it’s a passion. What makes it even more
              meaningful is that, through my classes, I also have the opportunity to raise awareness about important
              global issues. I regularly talk to my students about the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), helping
              them understand their significance and how we can all contribute to achieving them. I believe that
              awareness is the first step toward change—before we can act, we must first understand. By integrating
              discussions about SDGs into my lessons, I feel that I am contributing to something much bigger: empowering
              young people not only with language skills but also with the knowledge and motivation to make a difference
              in the world. Looking ahead, my team and I have ambitious plans to expand our efforts, introduce new
              programs, and reach even more students. I am excited about what’s to come and deeply grateful to be part
              of a mission that is making a real difference.</p>

            <p>I am so existing about sharing my success story of GPC class. You
              know , it hasn't been too much time that I have been joining at GPC
              class, but I have learned and achieved a half of assets that I wished. GPC class is not only place to
              enhance our education, yet it is also
              the place that we can meet new people and have friends from
              another country ( USA ) and it is where I found more incentive to
              pursue my education and to do not stop painting. after I posted
              some patterns of my artworks, My GPC Friends , OSA friends, and my
              teacher( professor Jay Villagomez) gave me motivations by
              their kind words that they caused I continue to paint more and more. Moreover, this class has provided
              more informations that I have needed. The teacher who makes the sources for classes that is amazing. Those
              sources are responsible for improving our informations that we have from anything. It is all about things
              that I have ever learned and achived from my dear teacher and my dear friends.Thanks millions of my
              resilient friend( Suhaila) to joined me at this group.</p>
